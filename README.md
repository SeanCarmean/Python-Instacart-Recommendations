# Python-Instacart-Recommendations
Helping *Instacart* make a targeted AD campaign.

Another project on my **CareerFoundry** course utilized Python in order to uncover sales patterns and trends for *Instacart*. The goal of this project was to assist the marketing and sales team uncover patterns by their users.

A few key questions I aimed to answer were:
1. Does a loyal customer have different purchasing habits than an infrequent customer?
2. What were the most and least popular products customers were buying?
3. What were the busiest days of the week and time of day customers were using the app?
4. Do certain demographics affect sales (marriage, income, age, etc.)?
5. Are there different spending habits of customers in different regions?
